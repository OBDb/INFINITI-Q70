    description: "The vehicle that would later become the Q70 was initially introduced as the Infiniti M, representing the third generation of Infiniti's mid-size luxury sedan. Built on Nissan's FM (Front Midship) rear-wheel drive platform, it featured flowing, organic styling with muscular fenders and distinctive wave-form details. Available as the M37 with a 3.7L V6 producing 330 HP or the M56 with a 5.6L V8 producing 420 HP, plus a hybrid variant (M35h) combining a 3.5L V6 with an electric motor for a combined 360 HP. All versions were paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive optional on non-hybrid models. The interior featured a distinctive, wraparound design with high-quality materials including genuine wood and semi-aniline leather on higher trims. Advanced technology for its time included available Blind Spot Intervention, Lane Departure Prevention, and a Forest Air climate control system designed to provide cleaner, more natural airflow. This generation established itself as a more distinctive and driver-focused alternative to established luxury sedans like the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class."

    description: "In 2014, as part of Infiniti's comprehensive nomenclature change, the M sedan was renamed Q70 without major mechanical changes. A significant expansion came with the introduction of the Q70L, featuring a 5.9-inch longer wheelbase dedicated almost entirely to increased rear passenger legroom. The powertrain lineup continued with the 3.7L V6, 5.6L V8, and hybrid system, though availability varied by market. A styling refresh in 2015 updated the exterior with a more prominent grille, revised LED headlights and taillights, and new wheel designs. The interior received minor enhancements to materials and technology features but maintained the same fundamental design. Despite these updates, the Q70 began to show its age compared to newer competitors, particularly in infotainment technology and driver assistance features. The model was discontinued in most markets after the 2019 model year without a direct replacement, as Infiniti shifted focus to SUVs and the smaller Q50 sedan. Throughout its production run, the Q70 maintained a reputation for smooth powertrains, distinctive styling, and generous interior space, though it never achieved the sales success of its German and Japanese luxury competitors, remaining a relatively niche choice in the midsize luxury sedan segment."
